# Base — Wallet Cluster Sniper

This doesn’t wait for new pools.  
It doesn’t care about names or liquidity.

It **stalks the real killers** — the top 5 sniper wallets that win 90% of launches.

The moment one of them buys — you get screamed at.

Because when Unibot, Maestro, Banana Gun, or Trojan hit "buy" at the same millisecond…  
you have about 4.7 seconds before the chart goes vertical.

## Run

```bash
python base_wallet_cluster_sniper.py
